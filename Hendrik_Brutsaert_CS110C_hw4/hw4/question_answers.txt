Counting sort questions
In big O notation, what is the expected efficiency?  
O(n) -  The array is accessed 3 times per item in the array
Why is counting sort impractical as a general sorting algorithm?
counting sort is impractical when the range of the large or undefined. then the count array will be prohibitively large.
